Exercise 1: Leap Year Checker
Write a program that takes a year as input from the user and checks whether it is a leap year or not.

Leap Year Criteria: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for century years (ending in 00), which must also be divisible by 400.
Sample Input: 2024
Sample Output: 2024 is a Leap Year.

    if ((year%4 == 0 and year%100 != 0) or year % 400 == 0):
        print("Leap Year")
    else:
        print("Not a Leap year!")

main()
